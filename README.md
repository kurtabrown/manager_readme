# Hi, I'm Kurt

My first preference is always for human face to face interaction so if anything in here is unclear, ask. If anything I say or do contravenes what's in here, call it out. If there's anything that isn't covered in here that should be, request it.

This document is not intended to replace or override the relationship and mutual understanding we will build as we work together. Its intention is to give you an idea of how I think and how I work and to try to give some context to our interactions. 

## My role as a manager

TL;DR: I am here to make sure our team is successful, happy, and working on the things that are most important to help our customers, improve our services, and improve our business. As a "General Manager" there isn't a lot of things that are outside the scope of my concern or interest. I don't always have the time or ability to dive deep into everything, but I'm committed to ensuring that the appropriate people are. More granularly:

1.  I am here to make sure you are both successful and happy: I want you to improve your technical skills, grow your career, enjoy your work, and be proud of what you do.
2.  I am here to make sure we are all pointed in the right direction. I believe in giving as much autonomy to people as they can handle. This can result in different folk having different plans. I am here to make sure our team is all aligned and pushing in the same direction.
3.  I am here to make you are getting what you need from others, be that other people within our organisation, our customers or our partners. 
4.  I'm here to help make sure we are working on the right things, which is not necessarily everything we're asked to do. We are all incredibly busy and there is always more to do than can be done, my job is to try to help us determine what's the most important thing to do right now.
5.  I'm here to navigate the intersection of our pipeline of work with your availability, workload, capability and interests.
6.  I'm here to make the DiUS mission and corporate strategy combine with the real world by keeping an eye on the commercial health of the business, the sales pipeline, the delivery of our current projects and the future direction we are taking.

These are all of approximate equal importance. If you are not successful and happy, I'm not not successful (or happy). If you are all not pointed in the right direction we will lose our way. If you are struggling without support this will impact your work and the success we bring to our clients. If we aren't focussed on the right priorities, our impact will be diminished and we won't push forward as much as we could. If we aren't aligning and balancing your goals and capabilities with the demands of our clients we are not going to have help our customer succeed and you won't achieve your full potential. If we aren't looking to move ahead with our strategy we will get stuck in the way we have always done things.

Additionally: My job is _not_ to tell you exactly what to do and how to do it. It is also not to be the "official decision maker" for you or your team. However, I am _accountable_ for the decisions the you and your team make, even if Iâ€™m not the one making them most of the time. As such I have tremendous interest in what is happening within your teams, your work and your life, and will do the best I can to help, guide and advise.

For context: I have been a commercial software developer since I left high school, although it has sometimes been accompanied by fancy titles like CTO. I was a consultant for over six years. I have engaged a firm similar to DiUS so I know what it's like to be a customer of ours. So, I have context. I have understanding. I have insight. But, I also know that my context, understanding and insight are limited to my experiences, and that your context, insight and understanding, combined with that of your teams and your clients, is worth much more than mine. So if it feels like I'm overstepping the mark, try to humour me. It can get dead boring being a general manager and sometimes it's nice to explore the cut and thrust of "real work". But if I try to intervene in a way that is detrimental in any way, call it out loud and call it out clear.

## Feedback

If you have feedback for me, please give it. It could be something you liked and would like to see more of, something you thought I could do better, something you thought I totally screwed up, or something that doesn't fit in any of these categories. Even if you think it might not be the case, I _do_ want to hear it. And if you think I don't want to hear it, I'd love to hear why you feel that way. Even if you aren't sure of how to phrase it, or what you'd like me to do instead, I know that because I am deeply human, I am therefore flawed. Just like you, I also want to grow and prosper in my career, and unless I know what I can improve upon I can't do that.

If you can give me this feedback in-person, I'd prefer that. If you're only comfortable kicking off a discussion with an email or a Slack message, I would rather you do that than not bring it up at all.

If you're not comfortable giving me this feedback yourself, I'd love for you to give it to one of my peers (Elliott, Nicole, Kirsty, Mick) or someone above me in the management chain so they can anonymously relay it to me and I can work on it.

Similarly, if you have feedback for a team member, I encourage you to give it to them directly; if you're not comfortable doing so, please feel free to relay it to me to pass along.

If you want to give direct feedback but aren't sure how or aren't comfortable doing so, let me know and we can talk through it.

## Schedule

I am usually "at work" between 9:30am and 5:30pm. I am often online earlier or later. My usual day involves a fair bit of travel to various customer sites, sales calls and the like so you won't always find me at my desk. I try to work from home when I can, but this is limited to once or twice a month at best. You have full visibility on my calendar through Google so please see that to schedule time with me. If you are working at a customer site, I prefer to come see you. It minimises the impact on the client but also gives me an excuse to visit and make connections whilst I'm there.

I prefer to do one-on-ones in person if possible, so if you need to work from home on a day we're scheduled for a one-on-one and rescheduling is an option, please let me know so I can reschedule it, or reschedule it yourself during an open slot in my calendar.

## One-on-ones

As I manage a team of over 50 it's impossible for me to schedule regular one-on-ones with regularity. I do however try to schedule these with team leads, particularly at the start of projects. In this case I will put thirty minutes on your calendar each fortnight for a one-on-one. If you need more time, let me know and I will adjust.

If you are not scheduled for a one-on-one, but have something you'd like to discuss - please let me know. I really want to know and I really want to discuss it with you. It is not an imposition on my time - it is my job.

One-on-ones are _your time_. I will probably have some things to discuss with you, but this is first and foremost your opportunity to let me know how you're doing, what you need, what you wish could be different, how you feel about our team and your teammates, what your career goals are... etc. These are for the conversations you might not necessarily have with me when we're sitting at our desks amongst coworkers. If you'd like to give me a brief status update on things you're working on or that you're stuck on, that is fine with me, but those are generally better-suited to a quick chat while I'm at my desk, an @ on Slack message, or an email or a phone call.

I encourage you to write down some things throughout the week that you want to chat about if you think that will help; it can be hard to think of or bring up things in the moment. If you have things you want to talk about but struggle with bringing them up, feel free to send me a vague agenda ahead of time. If you don't know what to talk about, say so. We can use that as a topic.

## Performance

I will give you feedback on how you're doing in our one-on-ones. If I'm worried about your performance, I will let you know. If you worry that I'm worried about your performance, please let me know. I will discuss your performance with your team lead, your team, your coach and your buddy to get an idea of where you and they might be happy and where you and they might have concerns. 

I strongly believe in confidentiality when it comes to taking and giving performance feedback and will not betray any confidences. Anything you tell me will be kept private unless you indicate it otherwise.

I equally strongly believe in transparency when it comes to taking and giving performance feedback, so I will often ask if I can share that feedback openly. It's ok to say no but I will challenge you as to why you don't feel you can.

I believe feedback is an opportunity to focus on what you do well as well as what you can improve on. I will endeavour to spend equal time on both items with you and I'd appreciate it if you could adopt the same attitude as me. This is not to try to placate people's feelings or hide bad news, I firmly believe we need to acknowledge and value what we do well to ensure it continues to happen.

## If you need something

Some weeks, my schedule can be pretty full. Other weeks it's not so bad. If you need to chat, you have a few options.

1.  Snag me whenever you see me - at my desk, in the hallway, on the street. If I'm about to have to run off for a meeting or have a deadline that means I can't stop, I'll let you know and figure out a better time to chat.
2.  Slack me or email me or text me or call me. Even if you want an in-person meeting, just message me to let me know you want to talk and I'll make time. If you would rather talk about something over email or message, that's fine too.
3.  Throw something on my calendar. If I am scheduled for an interview or something else I can't reschedule and you invite me to a meeting, I may chat with you and reschedule. If you see that I've blocked off the day as a "meeting-free day", that does not necessarily apply to youâ€”it's more to discourage folks from scheduling non-urgent meetings that day that could be scheduled otherwise. If you need to talk, schedule over this as much as you need.

If I'm working from home, you can expect me to be as available as I would be if I was in the office. Although it may feel weird to schedule a brief call or meeting when you'd normally just swing by my desk for five minutes, please do so without hesitation if you think chatting face-to-face will be more useful than textual communication.

## My interests
Here are some things I love. If you ever want to strike up casual conversation and don't know what to talk about, these are good bets

* Family. I've been married to my delightful, intelligent, stylish and beautiful wife for over 20 years. We have two teenage kids, Ella (16) and Bailey (14) and they are my number one priority in life. We have a dog, Ivy, a Spoodle, who is super cute, super smart, super neurotic and much, much loved.

* Travel. I've lived in NY for 6 years, London for 2 and travelled a it outside of that. There are many, many places I've not been that I really want to (India, Turkey and South America spring to mind) and I've found hearing other people's travel stories goes some way to 

* Surfing. I've been a surfer since I was 12, but these days I'm limited in the amount of time I spend in the water. I love to share stories about surfing and hear about good breaks. I particularly love to get way with my mates to camp and surf.

* Reading. I read every night and whenever I can on weekends and whilst on vacation. My interests and pretty broad but some of my favourites include modern Australian fiction from the likes of Peter Carey, Tim Winton, Richard Flanagan; history told in a refreshing and interesting (such as Girt); American modern classics (Catcher in the Rye, Confederacy of Dunces, etc.); Spy fiction such as le Carre and Reacher; and the occasional work related item (for our Book Club of course!)

* Art. My family and I love to visit galleries and it's always been a passion of mine. Mostly modernist type stuff from Picasso and Cezanne, through to Warhol and Whitley, and I really try to keep up to date at places in Sydney like the MCA and White Rabbit.

* Social Issues / Politics. Can be a touchy subject I know. But if you really want to know, I'm a strong advocate of public education, a progressive on social issues such as gambling and drugs of addiction, helping to bridge the gap between our indigenous and non-indigenous citizens, a more transparent and empathetic approach to mental illness, sensible and immediate action on climate change, and addressing the increasing gap between the rich and poor. Feel free to stay clear of this subject if your views contradict mine, but I do love a healthy debate and whilst I obviously have certain leanings I have no rusted on beliefs and I always enjoy when someone shows me a side of an argument I hadn't considered before.

## Caveat

Take this document with a grain of salt: I wrote it! I have never experienced having me as a manager. If I'm your manager and something here seems off, bring it up with me in one-on-one or over Slack. It's also my first draft at this so please forgive any typos, grammatical errors or omissions.
