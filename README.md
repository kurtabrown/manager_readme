# Hi, I'm Kurt

My first preference is always for human face to face interaction so if anything in here is unclear, ask. If anything I say or do contravenes what's in here, call it out. If there's anything that isn't covered in here that should be, request it.

This document is not intended to replace or override the relationship and mutual understanding we will build as we work together. Its intention is to give you an idea of how I think and how I work and to try to give some context to our interactions. 

## My role as a manager

TL;DR: I am here to make sure our Sydney team is successful, happy, and working on the things that are most important to help our customers, improve our services, and improve our business. As a "General Manager" there isn't a lot of things that are outside the scope of my concern or interest. I don't always have the time or ability to dive deep into everything, but I'm committed to ensuring that the appropriate people are. Here's some specific things I see as my responsibility:

1.  I am here to make sure you and your team mates are successful and happy: I want you to improve your skills, grow your career, enjoy your work, and be proud of what you do.
2.  I am here to make sure we all know where we are going and are all pointed in the right direction. I believe in giving as much autonomy to people as they can handle. This can result in different folk having different plans. I am here to make sure our team is all aligned and pushing in the same direction.
3.  I am here to make sure you are getting what you need from others, be that other people within our organisation, our customers or our partners. 
4.  I'm here to help make sure we are working on the right things, which is not necessarily everything we're asked to do. We are all incredibly busy and there is always more to do than can be done, my job is to try to help us determine what's the most important thing to do right now.
5.  I'm here to navigate the intersection of our pipeline of work with your availability, workload, capability and interests.
6.  I'm here to make the DiUS mission and corporate strategy combine with the real world by keeping an eye on the commercial health of the business, the sales pipeline, the delivery of our current projects and the future direction we are taking.

My job is also to recognise that all these are of equal importance and need to be balanced against one another. If you are not successful and happy, I'm not not successful (or happy). If you are all not pointed in the right direction we will lose our way. If you are struggling without support this will impact your work and the success we bring to our clients. If we aren't focussed on the right priorities, our impact will be diminished and we won't push forward as much as we could. If we aren't aligning and balancing your goals and capabilities with the demands of our clients we are not going to have help our customer succeed and you won't achieve your full potential. If we aren't looking to move ahead with our strategy we will get stuck in the way we have always done things.

I have been a commercial software developer since I left high school, although it has sometimes been accompanied by fancy titles like CTO. I was a consultant for over six years. I have engaged a firm similar to DiUS so I know what it's like to be a customer of ours. So, I have context. I have understanding. I have insight. But, I also know that my context, understanding and insight are limited to my experiences, and that your context, insight and understanding, combined with that of your teams and your clients, is worth much more than mine. So if it feels like I'm overstepping the mark, try to humour me. It can get dead boring being a general manager and sometimes it's nice to explore the cut and thrust of "real work". But if I try to intervene in a way that is detrimental in any way, call it out loud and call it out clear.

## Feedback

I believe feedback is an opportunity to focus on what you do well as well as what you can improve on. I would encourage you to think about and share aspects of my performance that you want to see more of, as well as what you'd like to see less of. In return I will endeavour to spend equal time on both items with you when I provide feedback for you. This is not to try to placate people's feelings or hide bad news, I firmly believe we need to acknowledge and value what we do well to ensure it continues to happen.

I really do want your feedback. I understand I have strengths and weaknesses like everyone else. I am busy just like you so I can sometimes overlook things that are important. Just like you, I also want to grow and prosper in my career, and unless I know what I can improve upon I can't do that.

If you have feedback for me, please give it. Even if you think I might not want to hear it. Even if you aren't sure of how to phrase it, or what can you'd like me to do. Let me know and we can start a discussion on how best to engage.

If you can give me this feedback in-person, I'd prefer that. If you're only comfortable kicking off a discussion with an email or a Slack message, I would rather you do that than not bring it up at all.

If you're not comfortable giving me this feedback yourself, I'd love for you to give it to one of my peers (Elliott, Nicole, Kirsty, Mick) or someone above me in the management chain so they can anonymously relay it to me and I can work on it.

Similarly, if you have feedback for a team member, I encourage you to give it to them directly; if you're not comfortable doing so, please feel free to relay it to me to pass along.

If you want to give direct feedback but aren't sure how or aren't comfortable doing so, let me know and we can talk through it.

I have created a feedback form that I hope will add some way of tracking my performance objectively over time. The link is below. It essentially encourages you to rank me on a core bunch of skills and allows for more details on particular skills/tasks if you feel comfortable.

## Schedule

I am usually "at work" between 9:30am and 5:30pm. I am often online earlier or later. My usual day involves a fair bit of travel to various customer sites, sales calls and the like so you won't always find me at my desk. You have full visibility on my calendar through Google so please see that to schedule time with me. If you are working at a customer site, I prefer to come see you. It minimises the impact on the client but also gives me an excuse to visit and make connections whilst I'm there.

I prefer to do one-on-ones in person if possible, so if you need to work from home on a day we're scheduled for a one-on-one and rescheduling is an option, please let me know so I can reschedule it, or reschedule it yourself during an open slot in my calendar.

## One-on-ones

As I manage a team of over 50 it's impossible for me to schedule regular one-on-ones with regularity. I do however try to schedule these with team leads, particularly at the start of projects. In this case I will put thirty minutes on your calendar each fortnight for a one-on-one. If you need more time, let me know and I will adjust.

If you are not scheduled for a one-on-one, but have something you'd like to discuss - please let me know. I really want to know and I really want to discuss it with you. It is not an imposition on my time - it is my job.

One-on-ones are mostly about you and what you want to discuss. I will probably have some things to discuss with you, but this is first and foremost your opportunity to let me know what you think I need to know. I will ask some prompting questions and give you my understanding of where things are at, and this is your opportunity to point out things I've missed, correct my knowledge and work out how best I can help.

## Performance

I will give you feedback on how you're doing in our one-on-ones, as well as during our formal performance review process. If I have any concerns or questions about your performance, I will let you know. I will discuss your performance with your team lead, your team, your coach and your buddy to get an idea of where you and they might be happy and where you and they might have concerns. 

I strongly believe in confidentiality when it comes to taking and giving performance feedback and will not betray any confidences. Anything you tell me will be kept private unless you indicate it otherwise.

I equally strongly believe in transparency when it comes to taking and giving performance feedback, so I will often ask if I can share that feedback openly. It's ok to say no but I will challenge you as to why you don't feel you can.

## If you need something

My days ebb and flow. Sometimes my schedule can be pretty full, at other times it's quiet. Locking in a consistent time to check in is pretty tough, so if you need to chat, you have a few options.

1.  Snag me whenever you see me - at my desk, in the hallway, on the street. If I'm about to have to run off for a meeting or have a deadline that means I can't stop, I'll let you know and figure out a better time to chat.
2.  Slack me or email me or text me or call me. Even if you want an in-person meeting, just message me to let me know you want to talk and I'll make time. If you would rather talk about something over email or message, that's fine too.
3.  Throw something on my calendar. If I am scheduled for an interview or something else I can't reschedule and you invite me to a meeting, I may chat with you and reschedule.

As I said before, you reaching out to me for my support is not an imposition or a hassle - it's my job. I can't alwats react as quickly as you and I might like, but please help me ensure you are getting what you need from me. 

## My interests
Here are some things I love. If you ever want to strike up casual conversation and don't know what to talk about, these are good bets

* Family. I've been married to my delightful, intelligent, stylish and beautiful wife for over 20 years. We have two teenage kids, Ella (16) and Bailey (14) and they are my number one priority in life. We have a dog, Ivy, a Spoodle, who is super cute, super smart, super neurotic and much, much loved.

* Travel. I've lived in NY for 6 years, London for 2 and have also travelled a bit outside of that. But, there are many, many places I've not been that I really want to go (India, Turkey, Iran and South America spring to mind) and I've found hearing other people's travel stories goes some way to alleviating the travel lust but also inpires me to think about other places that should be on my list too.

* Surfing. I've been a surfer since I was 12, but these days I'm limited in the amount of time I spend in the water. I love to share stories about surfing and hear about good breaks. I particularly love to get away with my mates to camp and surf.

* Reading. I read every night and whenever I can on weekends and whilst on vacation. My interests and pretty broad but some of my favourites include modern Australian fiction from the likes of Peter Carey, Tim Winton, Richard Flanagan; history told in a refreshing and interesting (such as Girt); American modern classics (Catcher in the Rye, Confederacy of Dunces, etc.); Spy fiction such as le Carre and Reacher; and the occasional work related item (for our Book Club of course!)

* Art. My family and I love to visit galleries and it's always been a passion of mine. Mostly modernist type stuff from Picasso and Cezanne, through to Warhol and Whitley, and I try to keep up to date at places in Sydney like the MCA and White Rabbit.

* Music. I'm a triple J kinda guy. I've started taking Ella to gigs (San Cisco, Jungle Giants, Hockey Dad thus far) and I love live music. I like to keep up to date if I can but it's getting harder to bridge that generation gap! My range is kinda broad - older Aussie alternative rock (The Celibate Rifles, Painters and Dockers, The Triffids, Nick Cave), Ska from Jamaica (Desmond Dekker, Skatellites) and the UK revival scene (Specials, Selector, Bad Manners), US Indie Music (Violent Femmes, Smashing Pumpkins), Punk and Oi (Ramones, Sex Pistols, Cockney Rejects), even the occasional bit of Opera (Barber of Seville is a fave).

* Social Issues / Politics. Can be a touchy subject I know. But if you really want to know, I'm a strong advocate of public education, a progressive on social issues such as gambling and drugs of addiction, helping to bridge the gap between our indigenous and non-indigenous citizens, a more transparent and empathetic approach to mental illness, sensible and immediate action on climate change, and addressing the increasing gap between the rich and poor. Feel free to stay clear of this subject if your views contradict mine, but I do love a healthy debate and whilst I obviously have certain leanings I have no rusted on beliefs and I always enjoy when someone shows me a side of an argument I hadn't considered before.

## Caveat

I have never experienced having me as a manager, so this is what I think is my management style. If it's not accurate please let me know. This is my first draft at this so please forgive any typos, grammatical errors or omissions.
